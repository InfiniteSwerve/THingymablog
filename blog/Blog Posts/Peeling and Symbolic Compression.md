Locate in your environment a humming layered sound. Think a computer chugging along, or a vent spewing air. Focus on that sound, try and figure out what it's made of, *peel* it apart into all the specific auditory sensations you can find. You might find a dozen distinct sounds all packaged into that one idea of "computer humming". This happens all the time, with everything. One skill heavily emphasized in learning to sketch is actually seeing with your eyes, not your brain, don't let your brain turn that jumble of shapes into a face, look at it for what it is, a collection of curves and line. Draw that, not a face. This also exists in music, you can peel apart the music into finely minced pieces if you want. That guitar solo is not magic, you can hear if perfectly clearly if you want to. It just takes practice and effort. What else can you do this with? Can you peel apart a skill you don't even think about any more? What does it feel like to actually do that skill? What sensations are there? What are those sensations made of? This is how you learn to do things like wiggle your ears, or raise one eyebrow. You have muscles you didn't know you had, learning to use them is clumsy and you have to compile a lot of trial and repetition. If you want a good example of this in practice, try writing with your non-dominant hand for a week. See if you can break down how you write, and teach your stupid hand how to do it quicker.
