# Gently Pushing Towards a Better Way of Being

I'm bad at going to sleep on-time, I'm also bad at a million other things. What should I try to fix? How much should I try to fix? How do I make it stick? There's a lot  of questions associated with being bad at something and trying to remedy it. Humans are by default fucking awful at getting our of the way of our more "Rational" selves, this isn't always a bad thing since "Rational" here tends to be really deluded and misguided on average. My recommendation is start small, pick one thing, and grab a few actionable insights, make them mutually cooperative so you don't have to spend mind-space on juggling them. Just like you can improve your tooth-brushing-technique *and* start flossing; you can do a pomo, or take a shower before you meditate while keeping in mind that one specific thing you want to work on. Haste in building your personal garden of being tends to make waste, and you can't afford that. So be gentle, work within your limitations, and try to move very deliberately and slowly. This often fixes problems you're having trouble conceptualizing.
