Music is a language

* Trying to convey ideas or feelings through sounds
* Learn music the same way you learn a language, just try and copy things around you that you hear
* The way to get really good, is to make it feel like music is your first language
* "I learned everything by just listening to music, and tyring to copy it"



Two things you can do to become more connected and instinctive with your guitar

1.  Try and sing everything you play

* In some way you're trying to predict what each note you play is going to sound like
* You want to slowly understand more and more the function of each sound in the scale. When I normally play I'm just hopping around and grabbing notes trusting that what I grab will work. 

2. Steal everything you hear
   * Transcribe everything, not just solos and things you like.
   * The more you do it the more music you hear everywhere

When learning about scales

* Take each note and figure out what it offer. 
  The root is always good, so is the fifth, 
  people like the 3rd, it's 'melodic', the fourth is kinda weird, it wants to drop back
