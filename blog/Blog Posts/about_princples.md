##What are Principles?

I use principles to try and average my habitual behavior towards actions which increase my long-term goal fulfillment.

That's pretty abstract, here's an example of a principle:  

####Quality- Every movement of my mind will be precise, exacting and deliberate.

Quality is about control, and is the groundwork for my behavior in general. It says that in a given situation I should be entirely in control of and have access to awareness of the movements that my mind is making.

Each principle has components as well. For example:

####Quality is composed of-

* Be Intentional
* Attention is a Precious Resource
* Default to Precision over Speed
* Motion Should be Transparent
* Full Steam Ahead
* Be Mindful

Each of theâ€‹se components is basically a model of how my mind would ideally function in some specific way. 

For example, _Be Intentional_ states that any movement of my attention and mental states should be deliberate. 

Each component also comes with a set of instructions for how to follow a principle. And a set of probable outcomes from following the component.

For example, _Attention is a Precious Resource_ says that you should when possible constrain the state space your mind can easily occupy, this means getting ad-blockers, disabling news feeds, and adopting a [security](https://intelligence.org/2017/11/26/security-mindset-and-the-logistic-success-curve/) [mindset](https://intelligence.org/2017/11/25/security-mindset-ordinary-paranoia/) in regards to attention.

_Attention is a Precious Resource_ says that following its guidelines will probably decrease your attentional residue make your marginal rate of return on projects go up, a la. *deep work*

Each principle and component is really a hypothesis about what would help me accomplish my goals. I'm making an epistemic claim that, yes in-fact this specific behavioral pose will make me do things better. I'm also making a more meta claim that having a set of principles to follow **at all** is a worthwhile move to make.

 This list is not complete and is subject to addition and revision.

### **Quality-**

* Be Intentional
* Attention is a Precious Resource
* Default to Precision over Speed
* Motion Should be Transparent
* Full Steam Ahead
* Be Mindful
