I have two modes really, modes is the wrong word, but it extends the premise of what I mean. You could say lens, or way, or SoP. It's a gradient, with no grip on one end and maximal grip on the other. Gripping means shearing, bending, fitting, agenting, piecing, breaking, contorting. Such that a lack of grip is the absence of deliberate use of those things. Related is tracking, tracking is a how 'with it' you are in regards to a certain thing. The metaphor is pretty spot on, are you tracking the thing? Are you seeing the marks it makes? Are you aware of it's behavior through the woods? Gripping and tracking are effortful actions, it's very unusual to track a thing without gripping, but you can grip without tracking, in the general sense. When someone seems to understand a concept all the way inside and out, tracking that concept is easy. I think it has something to do with how well you chunk, how many connections you can make, and how much working memory you have. Every seen a conversation where one person is meticulously tearing an argument apart? They're tracking hard right there. You can track things or people or concepts or sounds. You need to track something to peel it, it can be helpful to track something to simulate or transpose it, but you don't always need to. Gripping is what you do when you are intoxicated or impaired in some way and need to behave as close to isomorphic sobriety as you can.
