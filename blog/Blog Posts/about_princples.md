Principles[^1]

I use principles to try and average my habitual behavior towards actions which increase my long-term goal fulfillment.

That's pretty abstract, here's an example of a principle:  

Quality- Every movement of my mind will be precise, exacting and deliberate.

Quality is about control and the groundwork for my behavior in general. It says that in a given situation I should be entirely in control of and have access to awareness of the movements that my mind is making.

 In this case movement means operation performed in the mind, the focus of my attention, so doing mental arithmetic, or gaging emotional states, trying to hold multiple things in my head at once etc. 

Each principle has components as well. For example,

Quality is composed of-

- Be Intentional
- Attention is a Resource
- Default to Precision over Speed
- Motion Should be Transparent
