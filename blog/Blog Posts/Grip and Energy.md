# Grip and Energy

Gripping is costly, and it requires a tribute to maintain. If you have no energy, you can't grip. If you're missing sleep, you can't grip, if you can't grip, you can't track. You can shore up your energy to let you grip by expending certain resources, coffee and caffeine tolerance, sprinting to access adrenaline, cold showers, amphetamines. You have options, but generally shoring up your defenses and making sure your energy reserves are topped up regardless of extraneous expenditure is a worthwhile endeavor.
